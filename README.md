# Multi-classification of Plant Leaf Images 
Multi-classification of plant diseases based on cut leaf images. 

We are parsing the root location of our dataset and extract the __folder names(labels), file_paths and the total amount of files for each folder__.
We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to be acquainted with our dataset. 
We identify specific Plant and labels that don't have enough files in order to split to _validation_ and _test sets_ and are removed.

The dataset is still imbalanced
